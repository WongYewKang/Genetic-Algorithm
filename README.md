This Python project implements a genetic algorithm to optimize routes across a list of cities loaded from a file. The algorithm simulates evolution over multiple generations, refining solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation to find the shortest route. Three selection methods—Random, Tournament, and Proportional Selection—are used and evaluated to determine the best convergence rates.
